The my goal for this project is to analyze and to visualize how the shooting preferences changed over the years, and also to create a regression model which predicts to enough offensive rate for each team to be in NBA Play-offs.

I've played basketball for long time and I am a big fan of NBA so that's why I chose it to anaylze. The data that I will use this project has been collected from [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021.html) by myself and it covers the years between 2000-2020.

* After finished the data cleaning process, firts of all I'd like to explain the variables of data. 

FGA: Field Goal Attempts 

2PA: 2-Point Fields Goal Attempts

3PA: 3-Point Fields Goal Attempts

FTA: Free Throw Attempts

ORB: Offensive Rebounds	

DRB: Defensive Rebounds

AST: Assits

STL: Steals

BLK: Blocks

TOV: Turnovers

PT: Points

# Visualization of Shooting Preferences by Years

* I will also use the Tableau to visualize it, and be use to another data that is called "Shooting Stats" from the same source. Firtsly, I will start it with rising of 3-Point attempts which changed to gameplay of basketball.
