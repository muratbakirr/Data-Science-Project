## Data-Science-NBA Analysis
## Introduction
The my goal for this project is to analyze and to visualize how the shooting preferences changed over the years, and also to create a regression model which predicts to enough offensive rate for each team to be in NBA Play-offs.
I've played basketball for long time and I am a big fan of NBA so that's why I chose it to anaylze. The data that I will use this project has been collected from [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021.html) by myself and it covers the years between 2000-2020.
